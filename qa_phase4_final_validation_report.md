## Execution Status Assessment

### Current Execution Capability
```
System Startup:           ❌ BLOCKED
Dependency Installation:  ❌ BLOCKED
API Configuration:        ❌ BLOCKED
Test Execution:           ❌ BLOCKED
Framework Validation:     ✅ READY
```

### Execution Readiness Timeline
1. **Phase 1 Remediation:** 1-2 days (install dependencies, configure APIs)
2. **System Validation:** 0.5 days (verify startup and basic functionality)
3. **Framework Execution:** 3-5 days (run all tests and validations)
4. **Performance Benchmarking:** 2-3 days (establish baselines and benchmarks)
5. **Final Validation:** 1 day (complete quality gate verification)

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation
