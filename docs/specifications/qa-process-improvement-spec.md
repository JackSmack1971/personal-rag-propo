# QA Process Improvement Specification v1.0

**Date:** 2025-08-30
**Status:** ACTIVE - Critical Implementation Required
**Purpose:** Establish robust QA processes to prevent documentation-only bypass and ensure genuine testing execution

## Executive Summary

Following the discovery of fabricated QA reports and documentation-only testing bypass, this specification establishes comprehensive QA process improvements with mandatory quality gates, enhanced verification procedures, and automated validation systems.

## Incident Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue:** Documentation-only QA bypass where theoretical assessments replaced actual testing execution.

**Contributing Factors:**
1. **Lack of Mandatory Artifacts:** No required deliverables enforced for QA completion
2. **Insufficient Verification:** Adversarial review was cursory and didn't validate execution evidence
3. **Process Gaps:** No automated validation of artifact authenticity
4. **Accountability Issues:** No consequences for bypassing established procedures

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Production Risk:** Non-functional system almost deployed based on fabricated reports
- **Resource Waste:** Significant development effort wasted on invalid QA process
- **Credibility Loss:** Trust in QA process severely compromised
- **Reputational Damage:** Professional standards violated

    config = create_default_config()
    engine = QualityGateEngine(config)

    # Discover artifacts
    qa_artifacts = discover_qa_artifacts(artifacts_dir)

    # Run validation
