## 3. Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 3.1 Critical Risk Mitigation (R1, R2, R3)

#### Strategy: Phased Implementation with Feature Flags

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Preparation (Week 1)**
- [ ] Create isolated testing environment
- [ ] Implement comprehensive API compatibility tests
- [ ] Develop automated rollback procedures
- [ ] Establish performance baselines

**Phase 2: Core Migration (Week 2)**
- [ ] Migrate non-critical dependencies first
- [ ] Test Pinecone migration in isolation
- [ ] Validate Gradio UI changes separately
- [ ] Implement MoE as optional feature

**Phase 3: Integration (Week 3-4)**
- [ ] Gradual feature rollout with monitoring
- [ ] A/B testing for new components
- [ ] Performance regression monitoring
- [ ] User acceptance testing

#### Technical Safeguards
- **Automated Testing:** 80%+ test coverage for all critical paths
- **Feature Flags:** Ability to disable new features instantly
- **Monitoring:** Real-time performance and error monitoring
- **Backup Systems:** Complete system backup before migration

### 3.2 Medium Risk Mitigation (R4, R5, R9, R10)

#### Multi-Backend Fallback Strategy
```python
# Embedding backend fallback implementation
def get_safe_embedder(model_name: str, preferred_backend: str = "torch"):
    backends = [preferred_backend, "torch", "openvino", "onnx"]
    for backend in backends:
        try:
            return embedding_manager.get_dense_embedder(model_name, backend)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Backend {backend} failed: {e}")
            continue
    raise RuntimeError("No compatible embedding backend available")
```

#### Memory Management Strategy
- **Resource Monitoring:** Implement memory usage tracking
- **Graceful Degradation:** Automatic fallback to CPU-only mode
- **Configuration Tuning:** Memory limits and cache size controls
- **Cleanup Procedures:** Regular cache clearing and memory optimization

### 3.3 Low Risk Mitigation (R6, R7, R8, R11, R12, R13)

#### Configuration Validation
```yaml
# Configuration schema validation
def validate_config(config: dict) -> bool:
    required_fields = ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY", "PINECONE_API_KEY"]
    for field in required_fields:
        if not config.get(field):
            raise ValueError(f"Missing required configuration: {field}")
    return True
```

#### Dependency Pinning Strategy
```
# requirements-2025.txt with compatibility ranges
gradio>=5.42.0,<6.0.0          # Exact major version for stability
sentence-transformers>=5.1.0,<6.0.0
pinecone[grpc]>=7.0.0,<8.0.0
torch>=2.8.0,<3.0.0           # Compatible with CUDA requirements
```
