  - Testing expansion: Additional 1 week for comprehensive security testing
  - Risk mitigation: Buffer time for newly identified security risks
- **Validation**: Based on detailed risk assessment and resource planning

### Impact Assessment
- **Implementation Impact**: Medium - Timeline extension required
- **Business Impact**: Low - Risk reduction justifies the extension
- **Recommendation**: Update project timeline and resource allocation accordingly

## 4. Budget Adjustment

### Original Claim
> "$98K total implementation budget"

### Corrected Claim
> "$98K-$113K total implementation budget (15% increase for security and testing)"

### Evidence and Justification
- **Source**: Resource requirements analysis and risk assessment
- **Specific Findings**:
  - Additional security engineer: 1 FTE for extended period
  - Testing specialist: 1 FTE for comprehensive validation
  - Security tools and training: Additional budget allocation
  - Risk mitigation investment: Justified by liability reduction
- **Validation**: Based on industry-standard resource costing

### Impact Assessment
- **Implementation Impact**: Medium - Budget adjustment required
- **Business Impact**: Low - Risk reduction provides strong ROI justification
- **Recommendation**: Secure additional budget approval for security enhancements

## 5. Risk Assessment Clarification

### Original Claim
> "Medium risk level with 8/13 risks validated"

### Corrected Claim
> "Medium-High risk level with 8/13 original risks validated plus 3 new risks identified"

### Evidence and Justification
- **Source**: Comprehensive risk assessment validation report
- **Specific Findings**:
  - Original risks: 8 of 13 confirmed with research evidence
  - New risks: 3 additional risks identified (R14, R15, R16)
  - Risk level upgrade: Medium → Medium-High due to new security risks
  - Enhanced mitigation: Comprehensive strategies for all identified risks
- **Validation**: Based on detailed risk analysis and industry benchmarks

### Impact Assessment
- **Implementation Impact**: Low - Mitigation strategies already include new risks
- **Business Impact**: Low - Proactive risk management improves outcomes
- **Recommendation**: Update risk register and communication materials
