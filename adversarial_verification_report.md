## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Original Report Discrepancy ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Description:** The original theoretical report contains claims that completely contradict actual test execution results.

**Evidence:**
- Original: "✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION" vs Actual: "❌ NOT PRODUCTION READY"
- Original: "85% test coverage" vs Actual: "23.4% test coverage"
- Original: "All features working" vs Actual: "0/6 tests passing"

**Impact:** Misleading assessment could lead to incorrect deployment decisions.

**Recommendation:** Reject original report as not based on actual testing. Use QA mitigation report as authoritative source.

### Issue 2: Missing Dependencies ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Description:** Critical dependencies (gradio, pinecone, pypdf, psutil) are missing, causing complete system failure.

**Evidence:** All artifacts consistently report these missing dependencies with specific error messages.

**Impact:** System is completely non-functional until dependencies are installed.

**Recommendation:** Execute Phase 1 of mitigation plan immediately.

### Issue 3: Security Vulnerabilities ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Description:** Multiple security issues identified including eval/exec usage and missing API key validation.

**Evidence:** Security scan results verified against actual codebase patterns.

**Impact:** Potential security risks if deployed in current state.

**Recommendation:** Address critical security issues before production deployment.
